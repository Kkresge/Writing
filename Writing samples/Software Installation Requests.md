# Software Installation Requests

A common ticket you’ll encounter on the help desk is a request for software to be installed. Most users don't have administrator privileges to their own computers, so even if they can download the installer file for a program on their own, they can't run the installer without an administrator username and password.

If the user is requesting a work-related program (such as Microsoft 365 or Dropbox), we can install it for them without permission from a manager. If they are asking for something that is definitely not work-related (such as Spotify), then we need permission from their manager to install it. Check the client-specific documentation for instructions on getting this permission.

Sometimes a user will download the installer file on their own, but when they attempt to run the installer they get a popup asking for administrator credentials. That's usually when they will call the help desk and request that we enter the administrator credentials. *Don't do this!* We don't know what installer we might be running, or where the user got it from. For all we know, they could have downloaded a malware program from a fake website—I've actually seen this happen! The image below shows an example of a website like this.

Instead, ask the name of the program they want to install and get the installer yourself from a legitimate source. Once you find the URL of the installer on your own computer, copy and paste the URL into a browser on the user's computer and download the installer.

The user may say something like, "*I already did that!*". If this happens, you may remind them it is part of our security policy to follow this procedure.
